### Problem Statement
I work for a school district that has asked me to advise their high school students on what SAT score they should be aiming for based on their intended area of study or school preferences.

### Data Sources/ Definitions

 1. sat_act_by_college.csv: Ranges of Accepted ACT & SAT Student Scores by Colleges (source: Compass Education Group)
 2. sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv: 2019 SAT Scores by Intended College Major (source: College Board) 

### Definitions ('25th -75th Quartile')
The 25th percentile is also called the first quartile. The 50th percentile is generally the median (if you're using the third definitionâ€”see below). The 75th percentile is also called the third quartile

### Analysis

1. Analyzed enrolled students SAT scores by college  - This data highlights the SAT scores in the 25th  and 75th percentile score of incoming students.
2. Analyzed SAT scores by intended college major based on scores in the Math and Reading/Writing sections along with the Total SAT scores
3. Excluded ACT data because comparable data for intended college majors was not available
